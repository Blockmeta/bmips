==Bytom Improvement Proposals==

Bytom Improvement Proposals (BMIPs) describe standards for the Bytom platform, including core protocol, VM specifications, client APIs  and contract standards.
Having a BMIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Bytom users.

==Abstract==

This BMIP describes a payment protocol that addresses the need for short URLs when scanning from QR codes.

==Motivation==

The payment protocol augments the bytom: uri scheme with an additional "payment" parameter that specifies a URL where a payment request can be downloaded. This creates long URIs that, when rendered as a QR code, have a high information density. Dense QR codes can be difficult to scan resulting in a more frustrating user experience. The goal is to create a standard that would allow QR scanning wallets to use less dense QR codes.

==Specification==

Url scheme:
<pre>
bytom:<address>?amount=<amount>&asset=<asset>&memo=<memo>
</pre>
example:
<pre>
bytom:bm1q3yt265592czgh96r0uz63ta8fq40uzu5a8c2h0?amount=888&asset=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff&memo=six_god
</pre>

{|
| address || Bytom address for receive payment.
|-
| asset || Asset ID of the payment request asset
|-
| amount || Number of the asset to be paid.
|-
| memo || UTF-8 encoded, plain-text note with max length of 64 characters.
|}
